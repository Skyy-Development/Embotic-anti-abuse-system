# **Embotic is Selling My Scripts Without Permission – So I Made Them Public**  

I recently discovered that **Embotic**, a hosting provider, has been **selling my scripts for $5** without my permission. These scripts, developed by me, **Skycodee**, were never intended for resale, especially not by a third party looking to profit from my work.  

## **My Response – Making It Public**  
Since **Embotic decided to sell my work without permission**, I have decided to make the script **public for free** myself. If people are going to have access to it, it should be on **my terms**, not through a shady resale.  

Now, **nobody has to pay $5 to Embotic**—you can get the script **directly from me, for free**.  

## **Why This Matters**  
- **Unauthorized Sales**: Embotic tried to profit from my work without permission.  
- **Fair Access**: Now, anyone can access it for free, ensuring no one gets scammed.  

## **What’s Next?**  
I demand that **Embotic stop selling my work immediately**. If they continue to monetize my content without permission, I will take further action.  

If you bought this script from Embotic, **you were scammed**—the script was never theirs to sell. I recommend **seeking a refund** and avoiding their services in the future.  

Now that the script is officially public, you can get it for free **directly from me** instead of paying for an unauthorized copy.
